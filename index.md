### CPSC 120

 * Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was one of my favorites due to the nature of blackjack. I have played blackjack a ton in my time before and always wondered how to code it into software. I was amazed by how simple yet challenging this lab was, but it was incredible to find the solution in the end. Through nested statements we were able to figure out how to add up all the cards, add a bonus to the face if needed, and other conditions such as winning or losing.

 * Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was a great lab due to its simple nature in creating a pattern. I love computer graphics, and seeing this lab be able to make patterns through loops makes me happy. There is a big satisfaction towards seeing it be made. The lab helped me understand loops, and how to use them productively within code.

 * Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 3 we learned about our first computer generated image. I have been a graphic designer for almost two years now and have always wondered how computers generate and trace graphics. Learning how deep within my software called Blender truly took calculations. The vast amount of code it would take to generate what I do is astonishing. In the lab, we learned how to use magick, output an image to a ppm file, and use functions to check if the correct file format is being used.
